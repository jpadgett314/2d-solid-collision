# 2d-solid-collision
Simulates some physics of solid 100% elastic collisions in 2d (pretty badly). Made and last touched in 2017.

This uses the SFML graphics library for rendering. I apologize for the lack of any sort of build script or other compilation instructions; I likely typed out a g++ compile command every time I built it.
